# rio-idle
General catch all repository for code developed within Rio Invest Inc.

This code is a value investing framework that evaluates the investing opportunity of stocks on the US market.
All evaluation is based off macroscopic financial statement data (Quarterly or even Annually) from the Macrotrends website.
A MySQL database can be generated with the functions inside "minnie.py" and "soyeon.py". This allows for quicker re-evaluation of stocks when changing the underlying model.


# Naming Convention
I take the liberty to name a wide variety of objects (directories, modules, functions) as I see fit. This usually means using foreign vocabulary or the names of some of my favorite people. 

As the title of the repository indicates, (G)I-dle plays a large roll in the self motivation of writing this code. When I get to see their names in my everyday work, it keeps me happy. Therefore all code will be divided into six categories:

Soyeon - SQL I/O & Maintenance

Miyeon - Visuals (Graphs?)

Soojin - ML

Minnie - File I/O & Scraping

Yuqi - Stats/Math

Shuhua - Archive/Obsolete
