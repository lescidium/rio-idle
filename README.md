# rio-idle
General catch all repository for code developed within Rio Invest Inc.

# Naming Convention
I take the liberty to name a wide variety of objects (directories, modules, functions) as I see fit. This usually means using foreign vocabulary or the names of some of my favorite people. 

As the title of the repository indicates, (G)I-dle plays a large roll in the self motivation of writing this code. When I get to see their names in my everyday work, it keeps me happy. Therefore all code will be divided into six categories:

Soyeon - SQL I/O & Maintenance
Miyeon - Visuals (Graphs?)
Soojin - ML
Minnie - File I/O & Scraping
Yuqi - Stats/Math
Shuhua - Archive/Obsolete
