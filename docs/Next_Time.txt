Things I'm working on at the moment:

Valeria in the Yuqi module. 
* Something that can be used more flexibly when the machine learning model for growth parameter is finished.
* I also wanna finish this rn because I feel like it will give me an intuitive feeling for how growth is used in valuation calculation.
    * Get valeria to run for a single company, and try out changing the growth around.

Number formatting in Yuqi. Individual functions can be applied to dataframes. This is cool. I'd like to test it.

Generating Xrray and Yrray for the ratios-growth linear regression.
* I believe the Xrray is done. As long as you loop over every tick with minnie.macro_ratios you're good.
* There is some "Y-ish" data when using minnie.macro_caps but the ACTUAL Y-label for the linear fit will be calculated growth params.
    * There ARE 3 growth param calculations currently made rn. So you could string together those functions with caps...
    * Honestly it's practically done, you just write a loop with macro_caps --> XXX_grow for each tick and that's your label.
* An interesting set of combinations to try:
    * (Price, Market Cap, ROI, PtI, FCF) x (simple, fit, runk, reverseFCF) = 20 combinations... (5x4)

QUESTION: What is a true fair value estimate? What future metrics can tell you that number is correct?
 *** If your discounting and forecasting assumptions match what actually happens in the future. ***
